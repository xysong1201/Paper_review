#### A function returns a value based on the given arguments
In Python, functions can be passed around and used as arguments.  
If the function is named without parentheses. This means that only a reference to the function is passed. The function is not executed. if the function is written with parentheses, it will be called as usual.  
Itâ€™s possible to define functions inside other functions. Such functions are called *inner functions*.   
Python also allows you to use functions as return values  
'''

def parent(num):
    def first_child():
        return "Hi, I am Emma"

    def second_child():
        return "Call me Liam"

    if num == 1:
        return first_child
    else:
        return second_child
