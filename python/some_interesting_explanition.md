#### A function returns a value based on the given arguments
In Python, functions can be passed around and used as arguments.  
If the function is named without parentheses. This means that only a reference to the function is passed. The function is not executed. if the function is written with parentheses, it will be called as usual.
Itâ€™s possible to define functions inside other functions. Such functions are called *inner functions*.
